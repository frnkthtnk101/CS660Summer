## Observations
the first part of the lab was pretty straight forward.
For python, there is an easy way an easier way of doing
things. I guess that is what you where trying to point
out int the first set of problems. Its good to know how
to do iterators multiple ways just in case you need to 
get to the knittty gritty. 
The last section was more research. The sorting thing
was the hardest part about it.

## Conclusions
There is allot of ways to handle data and handle how things
are done in python.

## running the code
I ran it in vscode with python3.7 for myrjob you are going to have
